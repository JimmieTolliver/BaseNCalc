# BaseNCalc
Basic calculator using multiple base numbers

This project was done for Per Scholas Skills Based Assesment.  It is a simple website that solely uses frontend techniques to make a calculator capable of calculating basic math operations on numbers with various base numbers.  It also does an error check to make sure correct characters associated with the number base are entered. Because there is no backend, the site simulates sending a contact form on the contact page.
